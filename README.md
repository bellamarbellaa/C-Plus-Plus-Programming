# C++-Programming-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Concepts
This repository contains a collection of short C++ programs that reflect what I learned in my Data Structures and Algorithms course as part of my undergraduate dual degree in Information Systems and Applied Computing, supplemented by independent learning. It demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts, including operations on different data types, the use of pointers, and memory management techniques such as static and heap memory allocation. The repository also includes implementations of common searching and sorting algorithms. Core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and binary trees are implemented in multiple ways, including both array-based and linked list–based approaches, as well as different types of binary trees.
