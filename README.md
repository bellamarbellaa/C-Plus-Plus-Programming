# C++-Programming-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Concepts
This repository contains a collection of short C++ programs that reflect what I learned in my Data Structures and Algorithms course as part of my undergraduate degree in Information Systems and Applied Computing. It demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts, including operations on different data types, the use of pointers, and memory management concepts such as static versus heap memory. The repository also includes implementations of common searching and sorting algorithms, as well as combined approaches that integrate both searching and sorting techniques. Core data structures such as arrays, linked lists, queues, and binary trees are implemented in multiple ways, including linked list–based and array-based approaches, along with different types of binary trees. To connect theory with practice, the repository also features simple real-world examples such as a playlist creation system and a line queue simulation.
